Hello everyone, ðŸ˜Š

This project is an interactive web application titled "4D Musical Spheres with Ripple Effect and Nursery Rhymes". It features a dynamic and visually engaging canvas where spheres fall and create musical notes upon hitting the bottom. 

The spheres generate ripple effects, adding to the visual appeal. Users can control various aspects of the animation and sound through a user interface, including gravity, spawn rate, sound scale, instrument type, and nursery rhyme selection. The project aims to provide an immersive experience combining visual and auditory elements.

This project demonstrates a blend of creative and technical skills, providing an engaging and interactive multimedia experience. I believe this project serves as a testament to my programming proficiency and facilitates my continued growth. ðŸš€
